# uProg_C_SHARP
uProg is an programmer for the AVR ucontrollers. I used it to program the ATmega8, ATmega88 and the ATtiny45.  
I use an FT232RL from FTDI and the FTD2XX_NET.dll to communicate whit the ucontrollers.
## No warranty, if you use it, it's on your own responsability.  
I stopped the developpement in C# and now I'll start doing it soonly in C++.
